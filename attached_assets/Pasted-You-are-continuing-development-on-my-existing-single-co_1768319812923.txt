You are continuing development on my existing single-codebase React + Express app. DO NOT rewrite the app. Implement ONLY the “Create Task from Time Entry” enhancement described below. Preserve all existing functionality (Clients→Projects→Tasks/Subtasks, time tracking timers/manual entries, attachments, sockets, etc.).

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
- React frontend under /client, Express backend under /server
- Do NOT change database schema for this feature unless absolutely necessary (it should not be necessary)
- Do NOT remove/rename any endpoints; reuse existing task creation endpoints
- Use existing UI patterns (slide-out panels; avoid introducing new modal systems)
- If realtime events are emitted, ALL emits must go through /server/src/realtime/events.ts

===============================================================================
GOAL
===============================================================================
When creating a new time entry (manual entry modal/slide-out AND timer finalize flow),
if the user cannot find a task in the selected project, they must be able to create a new task
directly from the time entry UI, and then immediately assign the time entry to that new task.

This must work without leaving the time entry flow.

===============================================================================
1) UI/UX REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
===============================================================================

Where this must work:
A) Manual “New Time Entry” slide-out/modal (wherever time entries are created)
B) Timer “Finalize / Save & Stop” slide-out (when stopping timer)
C) (Optional) Timer Start flow if you require task selection at start

Behavior:
1) The user selects Client → Project
2) The Task dropdown loads tasks for the project (open tasks by default)
3) In the Task dropdown area provide:
   - a visible button/link: “+ Create New Task”
   - show it:
     - always, OR at least when no tasks match search / list empty
4) Clicking “+ Create New Task” opens an inline slide-out section (or nested slide-out) with fields:
   - Task Title (required)
   - Description (optional)
   - Priority (optional, if your tasks support it)
   - Status/Section (optional; default to first active section)
   - Assignee (optional)
   - Tags (optional)
   - Confirm Create button

After creating:
- Create task via API under the currently selected project
- Refresh tasks list for that project
- Auto-select the newly created task in the time entry UI
- If the new task has subtasks (none initially), do not show subtask dropdown
- User can then save the time entry immediately (or finalize timer)

Edge cases:
- If Client or Project is not selected, disable “Create New Task” and show tooltip:
  “Select a project first.”
- If the task create request fails, show error and keep user in time entry flow.

===============================================================================
2) BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (REUSE EXISTING ENDPOINTS)
===============================================================================
Do NOT create new task creation APIs if one already exists.

Reuse one of:
- POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/tasks
or existing equivalent.

Payload must include at minimum:
- title
- description? and any other existing task fields

Ensure response returns new task object with id and projectId.

If task creation currently requires additional fields, provide safe defaults on server (e.g., status = “Open”).

===============================================================================
3) TIME ENTRY INTEGRATION (MANDATORY)
===============================================================================
When the new task is created and auto-selected:
- Time entry should store taskId = newTask.id
- Save/create time entry uses the same API as before
- Timer finalize uses the same API as before

Ensure cascading dropdown logic remains:
- Changing project resets selected task/subtask
- After task creation, selected task should remain consistent with the current project

===============================================================================
4) REALTIME (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
===============================================================================
If you already emit task:created, ensure it fires (via /server/src/realtime/events.ts).
Also ensure time entry creation/update events still function.

===============================================================================
5) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MUST WORK)
===============================================================================
1) In New Time Entry UI, user can click “+ Create New Task” after selecting a project
2) Task is created successfully and appears in the task dropdown without leaving the flow
3) Newly created task is auto-selected
4) User can save the time entry and it is linked to that new task
5) Same workflow works in Timer Finalize panel before stopping timer
6) No existing features are broken

===============================================================================
6) OUTPUT REQUIRED
===============================================================================
When done, output:
- Summary of changes
- Files modified
- Any endpoints reused/added (should be reused)
- Manual test steps for acceptance criteria
