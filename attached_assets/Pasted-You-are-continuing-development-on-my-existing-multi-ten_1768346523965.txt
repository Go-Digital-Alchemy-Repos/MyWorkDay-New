You are continuing development on my existing multi-tenant React + Express app (single codebase).
Implement ONLY the features described below. DO NOT rewrite the app.
This prompt must be SAFE, additive, tenant-scoped, and non-destructive.

===============================================================================
ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE SAFETY RULES
===============================================================================
- Do NOT remove or rename existing endpoints.
- Do NOT change response shapes in a breaking way (you may add fields).
- Do NOT drop or rename database tables or columns.
- Add-only schema changes only if absolutely necessary; prefer reusing existing data.
- Do NOT modify authentication strategy, tenancy enforcement behavior, onboarding, or agreements (Phase 3C is not part of this).
- Do NOT reintroduce small edit modals; use full-width slide-out drawers for detail/edit screens.
- Ensure strict tenant isolation: tenant users only see their tenant; super_user can “act as tenant” but must never leak cross-tenant data in normal mode.

===============================================================================
FEATURE 1: NEW “PROJECTS” DASHBOARD NAV ITEM (ALL USER TYPES)
===============================================================================
GOAL
Add a new main navigation item called “Projects” that appears:
- Under “My Tasks”
- Above “Clients”
For ALL user types (super_user, admin, employee, client) when viewing a tenant context.

This “Projects” page is a dashboard/list that provides visibility across all projects from one place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1A) UI ROUTE + PAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add route: /projects
- Page shows a Projects dashboard with:
  - Search (by project name)
  - Filters: status (active/inactive if present), workspace (if present), client (if your model has clients), assignee/team (optional)
  - Table/list columns (minimum):
    - Project Name
    - Client (if applicable)
    - Status
    - Due date (if exists)
    - # Open Tasks (if feasible)
    - Assigned team / owner (if exists)
    - Updated date
- Clicking a project row opens a FULL-WIDTH slide-out drawer (Project Detail Drawer) to review project details.
  - Reuse existing project detail/editor UI if already implemented.
  - No small modals.

If you already have a project list page, reuse it and enhance into a unified dashboard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1B) DATA FETCHING (REUSE EXISTING ENDPOINTS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prefer using existing endpoints:
  - GET /api/.../projects (existing)
  - GET /api/.../projects/:id
- If an endpoint is missing for listing projects with basic metadata, add an ADD-ONLY endpoint:
  - GET /api/v1/projects?includeCounts=true
But do NOT break any existing routes; only add.

Counts:
- If counting open tasks is expensive, implement it as optional:
  - includeCounts=true triggers counts
  - default list does not compute counts

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1C) ROLE BEHAVIOR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Tenant Admin/Employee/Client:
  - only see projects in their tenant.
  - if existing permissions restrict access, preserve them (don’t broaden access unexpectedly).
- Super Admin:
  - sees projects only when acting-as-tenant (X-Tenant-Id or existing mechanism).
  - In super context, do not show a cross-tenant mega list unless explicitly required (not required in this prompt).

===============================================================================
FEATURE 2: SUPER ADMIN “PROJECT OVERSIGHT” CAPABILITIES (ON BEHALF OF A TENANT)
===============================================================================
GOAL
Super Admins need more granular control for administering and configuring projects on behalf of a tenant.

Implement this using the safest pattern:
- Super Admin uses “Act as Tenant”
- While acting as tenant, Super Admin can access the same /projects dashboard and project drawer
- Super Admin can perform admin-level actions permitted by existing authorization rules (or a controlled override if you already have one)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2A) ACT-AS-TENANT REQUIREMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Ensure the existing “Act as Tenant” capability is present and stable:
  - A super_user can set an effective tenantId (via UI + header).
  - All project APIs use effectiveTenantId for super user while acting-as-tenant.
- IMPORTANT: Super routes must never be blocked by tenant status guard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2B) SUPER ADMIN CONTROLS IN PROJECT DRAWER (ADDITIVE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Project Detail Drawer, when role=super_user acting-as-tenant:
- Add an “Admin Tools” section (visible only to super_user):
  - View tenant + project identifiers (read-only)
  - Quick links: open client (if tied), open tasks, open time tracking (if exists)
  - Ability to edit project settings (only if tenant admin can already; do not bypass permissions unless you already allow super override)
  - Optional: “Impersonate tenant admin view” (UI-only) is NOT required—avoid risky impersonation.

Do NOT create new destructive powers (like mass deletions) in this prompt.

===============================================================================
FEATURE 3: TENANT ADMIN WORKLOAD / TASKS-BY-EMPLOYEE REPORTS (TENANT SETTINGS)
===============================================================================
GOAL
Tenant Admin needs a new section in their tenant admin settings that provides workload visibility:
- tasks by employee
- key report types that help decide task assignment based on workload

This is a tenant-scoped reporting dashboard; do NOT change existing time tracking reports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3A) UI LOCATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Tenant Admin Account/Settings area (or Global Settings if that’s where admin settings live):
- Add a new tab/section: “Workload” (or “Task Workload”)
- Visible only to tenant admins (role=admin)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3B) REPORTS TO INCLUDE (MINIMUM)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provide these reports (tenant-scoped):
1) Tasks by Employee (Open Workload)
- For each employee:
  - # Overdue tasks
  - # Due today
  - # Due in next 7 days
  - # Total open tasks
  - Optional: # Open subtasks
- Filter controls:
  - Workspace (if applicable)
  - Client (if applicable)
  - Project
  - Date range for “Upcoming window” (default 7 days)

2) Tasks by Status / Priority (Summary)
- Counts grouped by status and priority
- Optional: stacked chart

3) “Unassigned Tasks” queue (if applicable)
- List open tasks with no assignee(s)
- Quick assign (opens Task Drawer; assignment handled there)

IMPORTANT:
- If you have multi-assignee support already, workload must count tasks where the employee is among assignees.
- If not, use your existing single-assignee field.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3C) DATA ACCESS / ENDPOINTS (PREFER REUSE, ADD ONLY IF NEEDED)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prefer using existing task list endpoints and aggregate client-side ONLY if dataset is small.
- If dataset is large or you already have server-side reporting patterns, add ADD-ONLY endpoints:

GET /api/v1/reports/workload/tasks-by-employee
- returns aggregated counts and optionally a small sample list for drill-down

GET /api/v1/reports/workload/unassigned
- returns list of unassigned tasks for quick access

Rules:
- Endpoints must be tenant-scoped by effectiveTenantId.
- Admin-only authorization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3D) DRILL-DOWN UX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Clicking an employee row opens a drawer/panel showing the list of that employee’s open tasks.
- Clicking a task opens the Task Detail Drawer (reuse existing drawer).
- Keep everything consistent with the “no small modals” direction.

===============================================================================
VALIDATION, PERFORMANCE, AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS
===============================================================================
- No N+1 queries: if you add server endpoints, aggregate efficiently.
- Pagination for any list > 50 items.
- Ensure “client users” don’t gain access to internal workload reports.
- Do not leak cross-tenant data in any response.
- Add loading/error empty states in UI; do not silently fail.

===============================================================================
TESTS (MANDATORY MINIMUM)
===============================================================================
1) projects_dashboard_access.test.ts
- tenant user only sees tenant projects
- super_user without acting-as-tenant cannot list tenant projects (or sees empty)
- super_user acting-as-tenant can list tenant projects

2) workload_reports_admin_only.test.ts
- tenant admin can access workload endpoints/page
- employee/client cannot

3) tenant_isolation_projects_workload.test.ts
- tenant A cannot see tenant B projects/workload

===============================================================================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
===============================================================================
1) “Projects” nav item appears under My Tasks and above Clients for all user types (in tenant context).
2) /projects dashboard loads and lists projects; clicking opens project detail drawer.
3) Super Admin can act-as-tenant and oversee projects using the same dashboard + drawer with an “Admin Tools” section.
4) Tenant Admin has a “Workload” area showing tasks by employee and key summaries to judge workload.
5) No breaking changes; no auth/tenancy logic changes; no schema changes unless absolutely necessary; tests pass.

===============================================================================
OUTPUT REQUIRED
===============================================================================
- Files changed
- Any endpoints added (paths + purpose)
- Any schema additions (should be none unless required)
- Manual test checklist
