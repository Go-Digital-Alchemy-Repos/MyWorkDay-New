You are continuing development on my existing single-codebase React + Express app. DO NOT rewrite the app. Implement ONLY the “Personal Tasks in My Tasks” enhancement described below. Preserve all existing functionality (Clients→Projects→Tasks/Subtasks, time tracking, attachments, sockets, admin settings, etc.).

CRITICAL SAFETY RULES
- NO major refactors, no folder restructures, no framework swaps.
- DO NOT remove/rename existing endpoints, tables, or fields.
- Schema changes must be ADD-ONLY and backward compatible (no drops/renames).
- Keep existing project tasks working exactly as they do today.
- If realtime emits are needed, ALL emits MUST go through /server/src/realtime/events.ts.

===============================================================================
GOAL
===============================================================================
Enhance “My Tasks” so team members can create and manage PERSONAL tasks that:
- appear in “My Tasks”
- are owned/assigned to the user
- are NOT required to be tied to a Client or Project
- coexist with assigned project tasks in the same view

Personal tasks should still support core task features (title, description, priority, status, due date, tags, etc.) consistent with existing task model.

===============================================================================
1) DATA MODEL (ADD-ONLY, SAFE)
===============================================================================
We need a way to represent tasks that are NOT tied to a project.

Preferred approach (choose one that fits existing schema with minimal change):

Option A (recommended): Allow tasks.projectId to be NULL for personal tasks
- Add/ensure tasks.projectId is nullable (if not already)
- Add a boolean field:
  - tasks.isPersonal (boolean default false)
Rules:
- For project tasks: projectId is NOT NULL and isPersonal=false
- For personal tasks: projectId is NULL and isPersonal=true
- Subtasks for personal tasks are allowed if your model supports subtasks:
  - subtask.projectId should also be NULL
  - subtask.isPersonal=true
  - parentTaskId points to the personal parent

Option B: Add a separate personal_tasks table (ONLY if tasks.projectId cannot be nullable)
- Strongly prefer Option A to avoid dual task systems.

If you add isPersonal:
- Add an index on (assigneeUserId, isPersonal, createdAt) or equivalent.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not change existing behavior for project tasks.
- Existing tasks with projectId not null remain unchanged.

===============================================================================
2) BACKEND API (MANDATORY)
===============================================================================
A) My Tasks list must include BOTH:
- tasks assigned to the user tied to projects
- personal tasks created by the user (isPersonal=true)

Update existing “My Tasks” endpoint if it exists, without breaking callers.
If needed, add:
GET /api/v1/my-tasks?includeProjectTasks=true&includePersonalTasks=true
Defaults:
- includeProjectTasks=true
- includePersonalTasks=true

Filtering:
- optional: status, due date range, priority, tags
- optional: showCompleted=true/false if you have completion logic

B) Create personal task endpoint
POST /api/v1/my-tasks
Body:
{
  title (required),
  description?,
  dueDate?,
  priority?,
  tags?,
  status/section? (if you use a status model),
  parentTaskId? (optional; to create a personal subtask)
}
Server behavior:
- Create task with:
  - assigneeUserId = current user
  - isPersonal = true
  - projectId = null
  - clientId = null (if tasks table has it; otherwise ignore)
- Validate that clientId/projectId are not required for this endpoint.

C) Update personal task
PATCH /api/v1/my-tasks/:taskId
- allow editing same fields as normal tasks
- ensure only the owner/assignee can edit personal tasks (unless admin)

D) Delete personal task
DELETE /api/v1/my-tasks/:taskId
- soft delete if your system uses it; otherwise hard delete ok
- ensure only owner/assignee can delete (unless admin)

E) Optional: Convert personal task to project task
Nice-to-have (optional): allow user to attach a personal task to a project later:
PATCH /api/v1/my-tasks/:taskId/attach
Body: { clientId, projectId }
- when attached:
  - set projectId
  - set isPersonal=false
  - now it behaves like a project task
This is optional; implement only if easy.

Permissions:
- Employee: can create/update/delete their own personal tasks
- Admin: can manage any task
- Client users: do NOT get personal tasks unless already supported (default: hide My Tasks for client role)

===============================================================================
3) FRONTEND UI (MANDATORY)
===============================================================================
My Tasks page changes:

A) Add “New Personal Task” button
- Opens slide-out panel (not modal)
- Fields:
  - Title (required)
  - Description
  - Due date
  - Priority
  - Tags
  - (Optional) Status
  - IMPORTANT: Client and Project are NOT required and should be hidden by default.
  - Optional: “Attach to Project” link that expands client/project selectors (only if you implement attach endpoint)

On save:
- Call POST /api/v1/my-tasks
- Update list instantly

B) List presentation
My Tasks should show two sections or a filter toggle:
- “Assigned Project Tasks”
- “Personal Tasks”
Or a single unified list with badges:
- Badge: “Personal” for personal tasks
- Badge: Project name for project tasks

C) Editing
- Clicking a personal task opens the same task detail panel style you use elsewhere
- Ensure edits work without requiring project/client fields
- For project tasks in My Tasks, keep current behavior.

D) Realtime updates (if you already use sockets)
- On create/update/delete personal tasks, emit events through /server/src/realtime/events.ts:
  - myTask:created / myTask:updated / myTask:deleted
- Update the My Tasks list instantly across tabs/windows.

===============================================================================
4) VALIDATION + EDGE CASES (MANDATORY)
===============================================================================
- Personal task creation must NOT require clientId or projectId.
- If tasks currently enforce projectId in DB:
  - migrate safely to allow null OR use Option B fallback.
- My Tasks should not break if projectId is null.
- Task dropdowns elsewhere (time tracking, project views) should continue to assume project context and must NOT accidentally include personal tasks.
  - Ensure project task queries filter out isPersonal=true (or projectId is null) as appropriate.

===============================================================================
5) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MUST WORK)
===============================================================================
1) My Tasks still shows assigned project tasks as before
2) User can create a personal task without selecting a client/project
3) Personal task appears in My Tasks immediately and is marked “Personal”
4) User can edit and delete their personal tasks
5) Project-related areas (project board/list/task selectors for time tracking) do NOT show personal tasks
6) No existing app features are broken

===============================================================================
6) OUTPUT REQUIRED
===============================================================================
When done, output:
- Summary of changes
- Any migrations added (add-only)
- Endpoints added/changed
- Files modified
- Manual test steps for acceptance criteria 1–6
