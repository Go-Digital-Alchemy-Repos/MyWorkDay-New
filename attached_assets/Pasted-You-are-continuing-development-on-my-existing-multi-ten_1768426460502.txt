You are continuing development on my existing multi-tenant React + Express app (single codebase).
Create a SAFE “Refinement Roadmap” of the next 3–5 implementation prompts based on the current system,
AND establish an ongoing documentation standard: continue annotating code and updating/creating READMEs
whenever notable new features/modules are added.

IMPORTANT: This prompt is primarily planning + documentation standards.
Do NOT rewrite the app or refactor broadly. Only propose the roadmap and implement the documentation standard
in a lightweight, non-destructive way.

===============================================================================
ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE SAFETY RULES
===============================================================================
- Do NOT remove or rename any endpoints.
- Do NOT change endpoint paths or response shapes.
- Do NOT change database schema.
- Do NOT change auth strategy or tenancy enforcement behavior.
- Do NOT redesign UI layouts in this prompt.
- If you must touch code, it should only be to add lightweight documentation scaffolding (docs files/templates),
  NOT functional behavior changes.

===============================================================================
PART 1 — REFINEMENT ROADMAP (NEXT 3–5 PROMPTS)
===============================================================================
1) Scan the codebase and list the highest-value refinement targets from:
- tenant health blockers / tenantId integrity (if any remain)
- agreement gating edge cases (Phase 3C)
- super admin tenant onboarding drawer usability
- mailgun settings persistence / masking
- S3 upload consistency (tenant branding + user avatar)
- time tracking editability and task/subtask selection
- navigation mode switching (super vs tenant) + impersonation safety
- performance issues (N+1 queries, heavy list endpoints)
- missing tests for critical flows
- error handling consistency

2) Produce a “Roadmap” document at:
- /docs/REFINEMENT_ROADMAP.md
Include:
- 3–5 next prompts (each titled and scoped)
- for each prompt:
  - objective
  - exact scope boundaries (what NOT to touch)
  - acceptance criteria
  - test coverage to add
  - risk level (low/med/high)
  - recommended run order

3) Ensure the roadmap prompts are SAFE:
- small, isolated, rollback-friendly steps
- avoid merging too many features into one prompt

===============================================================================
PART 2 — ONGOING DOCUMENTATION STANDARD (MANDATORY GOING FORWARD)
===============================================================================
Establish a “Documentation & Annotation Policy” and implement minimal scaffolding:

A) Create /docs/DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md with rules:
- Every new feature/module must include:
  1) a short module-level comment header in key files (routes/services/ui pages)
  2) a brief docs entry in /docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md
  3) updates to README or a module README when appropriate
- Annotate *why* something exists, not obvious syntax.
- For security-sensitive areas (auth, tenancy, agreement guard, impersonation, uploads):
  - include invariants + “do not break” notes
- Keep comments concise; avoid noise.

B) Create a lightweight “Docs Checklist” file:
- /docs/DOCS_CHECKLIST.md
Include checkboxes developers can follow:
- Added/updated endpoints documented?
- Tenancy isolation enforced?
- New env vars added to /docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md?
- Tests added?
- UI routes documented?

C) Add “Documentation Required” reminders in the repo in a non-invasive way:
- Add a short section to root README.md:
  “Documentation rule: When adding features, update FEATURE_INVENTORY + ENV vars + relevant README and annotate key files.”

D) Optional (but recommended) minimal conventions:
- For any new server route module created, add a small header block comment:
  - purpose
  - auth/role requirements
  - tenancy assumptions
- For any new major UI page, add a short header comment describing:
  - user roles
  - main API dependencies
  - key state flows

NOTE:
- Do NOT mass-edit all files now.
- Only implement these policy/docs scaffold files + README section.
- Future feature prompts should follow this policy automatically.

===============================================================================
OUTPUT REQUIRED
===============================================================================
- /docs/REFINEMENT_ROADMAP.md created with 3–5 next safe prompts in recommended order
- /docs/DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md created
- /docs/DOCS_CHECKLIST.md created
- README.md updated with short “Documentation Standard” section
- A brief summary of what was produced and where
